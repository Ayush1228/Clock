## 🧠 How It Works
### **HTML**
Defines the structure for the analog and digital clock — including the clock face, numbers, hands, and the digital display.

### **CSS**
- Styles the circular clock face and center point  
- Positions the hour numbers evenly using rotational transforms  
- Adds glowing effects, gradients, and smooth shadows  
- Creates responsive scaling for mobile screens  

### **JavaScript**
- Uses the `Date()` object to fetch the current time  
- Rotates the clock hands dynamically based on the current time  
- Updates the digital display every second  
- Automatically shows **AM/PM** depending on the system time
